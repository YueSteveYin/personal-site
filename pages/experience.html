                I have had the responsibility of ensuring the proper functioning and maintenance 
                of laboratory equipment, which includes managing and overseeing the operation of 
                various critical devices such as the 3D printer, laser cutting machine, and 
                computers. Additionally, I have played a pivotal role in maintaining order within 
                the lab environment and assisting individuals in becoming familiar with the 
                proper usage of these equipment, offering guidance and support as needed. 
                This experience has honed my technical skills while also allowing me to develop 
                strong communication and problem-solving abilities to provide effective assistance 
                to team members and lab users.
