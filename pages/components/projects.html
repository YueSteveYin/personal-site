    <h2>Gamified To-Do List Web App</h2>

    <h3>Project Description</h3>
    <p>
      This project is a web-based task management tool designed for developers and
      productivity-focused users who struggle with time estimation, consistency, or motivation.
      Unlike traditional to-do apps, this tool introduces a gamified system where completing tasks
      earns virtual currency that can be spent on caring for digital pets. Users who neglect tasks
      risk losing their pets, reinforcing consistent task tracking through soft behavioral nudges.
    </p>
    <p>
      The app supports custom task creation, real-time tracking through built-in timers, and visual
      comparisons between estimated and actual time taken. It encourages time awareness, improves
      personal planning, and motivates users to stay organized through a combination of visual
      rewards and progress monitoring. Each task includes features like start/pause controls and
      completion locking to maintain structure and prevent gaming the system.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>‚è±Ô∏è Task-level timers with pause and resume functionality</li>
      <li>
        üìã Task state transitions: Not Started ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Completed (no backward movement)
      </li>
      <li>üéØ Estimated vs. actual time tracking for every task</li>
      <li>ü™ô Coin rewards based on task completion and performance</li>
      <li>üêæ Virtual pet system: earn, feed, grow, or risk losing pets</li>
      <li>üì¶ Local storage persistence for offline usability</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Technology & Implementation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
      <li>
        <strong>OOP Design:</strong> Class-based architecture for task objects, pets, shop logic,
        and game state
      </li>
      <li><strong>CI/CD:</strong> Basic pipeline with pre-commit checks and linter integration</li>
      <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Browser localStorage for state persistence</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Code Practices:</strong> Code formatting, linting, test planning, and modular design
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Development Timeline</h3>
    <p>
      Development was divided into four sprints, beginning with setup (linting, CI/CD, brownfield
      checks), followed by UI creation, class definitions, logic for shop and pets, and finally
      task-to-reward conversion and repo cleanup. Future potential features include randomized pet
      loot-boxes and deeper personalization.
    </p>

    <h3>Challenges & Reflections</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Balancing the complexity of the pet system with the core productivity focus</li>
      <li>Designing intuitive UI without external frameworks or component libraries</li>
      <li>Managing state across tasks, pets, and user inventory using only vanilla JavaScript</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact</h3>
    <p>
      By combining task tracking with gamification, this web app makes productivity more engaging
      and rewarding. It helps users stay accountable, visualize time spent, and develop healthier
      habits‚Äîall within a lightweight, framework-free environment.

    <h2>Tasty Noodle ‚Üí Noodle Craft</h2>

    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
    <p>
      This project began as <strong>Tasty Noodle</strong>, a whimsical fortune-telling web app that
      generated noodle-based fortunes using algorithmically drawn noodles. Over time, it evolved
      into <strong>Noodle Craft</strong>‚Äîa recipe-generation platform that uses user input and
      generative AI to suggest personalized, customizable noodle recipes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The site lets users filter recipes like ramen, udon, spaghetti, or pad thai based on budget,
      available time, and regional preferences. Once a type is selected, users can customize the
      ingredient list and generate a tailored recipe using a GenAI backend. The design focuses on
      accessibility and ease of interaction, blending playful visuals with functional UX.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        üçú Noodle questionnaire to capture user preferences (e.g. time, cuisine, customization
        level)
      </li>
      <li>üß† Ingredient editing UI with intuitive add/remove functionality</li>
      <li>üìñ GenAI-powered recipe generation based on finalized preferences and ingredients</li>
      <li>üß© Personalized history system for saving generated recipes</li>
      <li>üé® Fun, accessible UI inspired by fortune-telling and cozy kitchen themes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Technology & Tools</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla)</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Backend:</strong> Firebase Hosting, Firebase Functions (GenAI API integration)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Accessibility:</strong> Designed with A11Y principles for screen reader and keyboard
        support
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>UI Design:</strong> Handcrafted layouts and animated feedback with a lighthearted
        visual identity
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>My Role</h3>
    <p>
      I worked as a full-stack developer for key features across both <em>Tasty Noodle</em> and
      <em>Noodle Craft</em>. I was responsible for designing page layouts, building accessible
      interactive components, and integrating backend logic for recipe generation and history
      tracking. This project sharpened my frontend skills and gave me valuable experience working
      with APIs, Firebase hosting, and real-time UI feedback patterns.
    </p>

    <h3>Impact</h3>
    <p>
      What started as a fun experiment became a usable, engaging platform for everyday cooking
      decisions. Noodle Craft shows how playful design and modern AI tools can come together to
      build something that's both delightful and practical.
