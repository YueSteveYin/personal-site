      <h2>Hello! I'm Steve Yin</h2>
      <p>Hello, distinguished viewer in front of the screen! I’m Steve Yin, a full-stack developer with a front-end specialty. I’m all about writing clean code and bringing ideas to life with passion. 
        Now, I know you don’t really know me yet—that’s okay. Even after reading this, you still won’t fully know me. 😉Even if you’re standing atop an iceberg, you might not see its full extent. 
        But isn’t that part of the charm? I believe that with my skills, if you truly get to know me, you’ll uncover plenty of surprises! For now, I invite you to take a small glimpse of what I have to offer.. 
        There's more to me than code—but you'll have to click around to see it. 😉</p>

      <h2>Tech Stack</h2>
      <p>Well, well, alright. Let’s cut to the chase. I graduated from UCSD with a degree in Computer Engineering, and now I’m working on my master’s in Computer Science. If you’ve seen my résumé, 
        you probably already know that. I’m not sure what you’re really curious about, but if you want a quick intro to my academic background——</p>

      <p>Let’s talk about me first—I’m not just some "glasses-wearing tech guy" who sits in front of a computer all day. If you ever see me play badminton, you’ll be in for a surprise! 
        I’m also into rock climbing, weightlifting, music, movies, and mixology. Oh, and I’m also a hardcore gamer</p>

    <div class="tab-content" id="story">
      <h2>Origin Story</h2>
      <p>My journey into tech didn’t start with textbooks—it started with chaos and curiosity. Back in elementary school, while other kids were memorizing multiplication tables, I was deep into Redstone circuits and Scratch games. 
        I built mini-games, designed maps, and wrote basic logic and functions. It blew my mind that I could actually build my own world—code could do things that even adults couldn’t figure out. That was the hook.</p>
      <p>The catch? I never finished a single map. Not once. Every time I got halfway through, my mom would find out, delete everything, and deliver the classic combo: scolding plus a bit of “parental feedback.” 
        But instead of quitting, that just fueled my obsession. Apparently, nothing sparks an interest in computer engineering quite like losing your work and your Wi-Fi privileges in the same afternoon.</p>
      <p>I didn’t choose software engineering because I thought I was some genius—I chose it because I’m genuinely in love with it. I can spend nights (and entire weekends) debugging one stubborn function, and somehow, it still feels worth it. 
        That tiny thrill when something finally works? Better than coffee. Almost better than sleep. Almost.</p>
      <p>I believe in building with purpose, learning with focus, and growing with consistency. 
        Right now, I’m seeking opportunities in software development—looking to contribute what I’ve got, keep leveling up, and turn inspiration into systems that matter.</p>

    <div class="tab-content" id="thanks">
      <h2>Special Thanks 💖</h2>
      <p>Huge thanks to my girlfriend for helping me figure out what to write for this website! 
        But when she tried, she said she didn’t really know me well enough to help (so sad to hear that lol), so she ended up doing a little interview with me and asking all sorts of questions. 
        After thinking about it, I figured some of these questions might actually interest you too, so I’ll just leave them here for your reference!</p>
