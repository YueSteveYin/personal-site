## Program Organizer

### Organization
UC San Diego – ECE Summer Internship Prep Program (SIPP)

### Period
Jul 2022 – Oct 2022

### Overview
After contributing as a student developer in 2021, I was invited back to lead the 2022 iteration of SIPP as a **Program Organizer**. In this role, I designed and led the software track for over 100 undergraduate students, focusing on core technical skills and project-based learning to prepare them for internships in the ECE industry.

### Key Contributions
- **Curriculum Design**: Created and structured the entire software-centric curriculum, covering **Python programming**, **GitHub version control**, **introductory machine learning**, and **computer vision**.
- **Instructional Development**: Authored comprehensive teaching materials—including lecture slides, annotated examples, and coding assignments—designed to build knowledge progressively and intuitively.
- **Live Teaching & Mentorship**: Delivered multiple live lectures and hosted office hours, mentoring students individually and in groups to reinforce understanding and project success.
- **Program Coordination**: Worked with other organizers and instructors to align schedules, content scope, and student support, ensuring a cohesive and well-paced program across all tracks.

### Impact
This role allowed me to apply my technical knowledge in a teaching context while developing skills in **instructional design**, **mentorship**, and **remote program management**. Many students who participated went on to apply their learning in internships and capstone projects, and I received positive feedback on the clarity and depth of the curriculum I developed.

### Project: Automatic Camera Tracking System (A.C.T.S.)
As a participant in the inaugural run of SIPP, I developed an independent capstone project titled **A.C.T.S. (Automatic Camera Tracking System)**—a vision-based system capable of identifying and tracking human faces in real time using **Python** and **OpenCV**.

### Highlights
- Designed the full pipeline for object detection, motion prediction, and servo-based tracking logic.
- Implemented facial recognition using Haar Cascades and integrated it with hardware simulation for camera movement.
- Wrote modular, annotated code and documented my process for presentation and reproducibility.
- Demonstrated the completed system to faculty and peers, showcasing both technical complexity and user-focused interaction.

### Outcome
This project helped me develop a solid foundation in **computer vision**, **real-time image processing**, and **hands-on systems thinking**. My performance and initiative during the program led directly to my selection as a Program Organizer the following year.
