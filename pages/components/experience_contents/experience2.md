## Lead Software Engineer

### Organization

Research Corporation for Science Advancement (RCSA)

### Period

Jun 2024 – Sep 2024

### Project Overview

I independently designed and developed a multi-page website dedicated to highlighting the contributions of underrepresented scientists and their groundbreaking research. This project aimed to bring visibility to important scientific achievements that have often been overlooked.

In addition to development, I collaborated with another researcher to gather and curate scientific content, ensuring its accuracy and relevance. While my primary responsibility was web development, I also contributed to research efforts to ensure no key contributions were missed.

### Technical Implementation & Challenges Overcome

- Chose **Hugo** as the static site framework, ideal for multi-page content architecture.
- Gained hands-on experience with **Go**, **Hugo**, and **Pagefind**—despite being new to these technologies, I mastered them within days.
- Developed a clean, scalable, and fast-loading website with optimized navigation and layout.
- Implemented **user access management** to control visibility across different sections of the static site.
- Built a **structured backup system** to safeguard all project content and configuration files.

### Collaboration & Communication

- Conducted regular online meetings with professors from UC San Diego and other RCSA-affiliated universities.
- Since many collaborators were non-technical, I translated technical progress into accessible presentations using visual aids and simple language.
- Maintained clear, respectful, and efficient communication with teammates and mentors throughout the project.

### Reflections

This project pushed me to rapidly adapt to new tools and frameworks while balancing both technical and research responsibilities. I strengthened my full-stack development capabilities, improved my scientific communication skills, and learned how to lead a technically complex project with non-technical stakeholders. The experience was deeply rewarding, and the final product received positive feedback from the professors involved.
