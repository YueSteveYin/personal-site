## Researcher – Text Readability

### Location
La Jolla, CA

### Period
Oct 2023 – Jan 2024

### Research Focus
Conducted user experience research focused on evaluating **text readability and comprehension** across web interfaces. The project aimed to identify how web design and text formatting influence user understanding and engagement, with implications for accessibility and content strategy.

### Responsibilities & Technical Contributions
- Developed custom **JavaScript-based data collection tools** to track user behavior and engagement patterns on various web pages.
- Engineered a robust analytical function incorporating **50+ variables**, including scroll behavior, time-on-section, and visual hierarchy metrics, to quantify user engagement and reading efficiency.
- Ran multiple user interaction trials and interpreted results using statistical and behavioral analysis methods.
- Iteratively refined testing scripts and engagement models to improve accuracy and reduce noise in real-world testing environments.

### Collaboration & Guidance
- Worked under the supervision of **Professor Thomas A. Powell**, a leading expert in web development and standards.
- Regularly shared findings and tool iterations with Professor Powell, incorporating feedback to improve methodological precision and relevance.
- Helped translate research outcomes into actionable insights for enhancing **web accessibility**, **readability design patterns**, and **user-centered content layout** strategies.

### Reflections
This research deepened my understanding of the intersection between design and human behavior. I learned how to combine technical tool building with behavioral analysis to assess user experience in a measurable way. The experience sharpened my data analysis skills, enhanced my frontend scripting abilities, and gave me a new appreciation for designing websites that are not just functional—but intuitive and reader-friendly.
